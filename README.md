# Favorites - Bookmark system for Contao BE
**Injects bookmarks into the BE navigation**

You can easily add any url in the BE to the favorites menu to create article, CE, modules and other deep links. Icons are automatically calculated.

You can add, remove and manage the order of the favorites. To manage you will need to provide USER module access to a BE user.

You can also lock the favorites, so no more changes are allowed and also redirect the HOME landing point to the first Shortcut in the Favorites menu (instead of the System messages).

External URLs can now also be specified to open in a new window, with a new default icon (redirect page icon).
